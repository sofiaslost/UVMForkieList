### Hi & Welcome to UVMForkieList's repo

---

This page is for people who suck (a.k.a. being a forkie) Unfortunatley this community isn't very mature so they resort the naming them by the R and F slurs. (whatever they did)f*g and retap basically. (Don't use these terms please)

So that's why we created this website. We wanted a way to list all of the forkies we find on UserVM

Check it out Below!

Also credit to [@sofiaslost](https://github.com/sofiaslost) for helping me with the css and other design flaws (see pull requests)
