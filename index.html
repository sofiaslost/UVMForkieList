    <h2>Forkies:</h2>
    <p>Emmanuel Flores/Vista/Ubuntu: <pre>Restarts for no reason, and likes to install Monoxide and Holzer on the VMs</pre></p>
    <p>sprunki: <pre>Constantly tries to upgrade/downgrade to Windows 8.1, don't know why</pre></p>
  
    <br>
  
    <h2>Complainers (people who aren't forkies but decide to complain ALOT)</h2>
    <p>Windows 11: <pre>Won't shut up about a city bus theme I put on XP, technically is a forkie for supporting other people installing monoxide, also gets extremely fucking mad if you say "city bus go beep beep :-)"</pre></p>
    <p>Charmander: <pre>Won't be quiet about me complaining about forkies ruining the OS, <b>which me saying that is a valid complaint,</b> also links to very outdated screenshots of me complaining, and is digging up info on me for no reason</pre></p>
    <p>guest30208/plane3: <pre>Is a literal fucking copy machine, won't shut up and just repeats what you say like a parrot with brain disease</pre></p>
    <p>PrincessLunaZ: <pre>For some reason has a big grudge against me and does everything to make me look bad</pre></p>
    
    <br>
    
    <p>And guess what? The above forkies still cause mayhem, even after repeated warning. <pre>Luckily the people at <a href="https://discord.gg/Ps9ujNZqvg">AnyaHosting</a> actually take action.
